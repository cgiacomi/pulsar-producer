# Pulsar Producer

Simple producer that sends messages to an Open (unsecured) Pulsar cluster.

DISCLAIMER: DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION!!!!

This repo is a work in progress and something I use to test Pulsar and various Pulsar consumers.

The code assumes that you are sending a valid JSON payload to Pulsar.
